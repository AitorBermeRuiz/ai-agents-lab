About

I am a passionate developer specialized in building cross-platform applications and cloud solutions, with more than two years of experience as a Cloud & API Solution Developer.

My professional career focuses on developing Web APIs, Azure Functions, and Logic Apps within Microsoft Azure, as well as managing the full API lifecycle using tools like Azure API Management, with a strong emphasis on implementing an ApiOps governance model from scratch.

I have worked with key technologies such as C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, and modern frameworks, playing a key role in projects that require cloud-based design, implementation, and deployment.

I am certified in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure (AZ-204), demonstrating my ability to build and optimize applications and services in cloud environments.

My career path also includes experiences outside the tech sector, which have allowed me to develop essential skills such as resilience, teamwork, and effective communication. These values help me approach technical challenges with a broad and collaborative perspective.

My constant motivation to learn and grow—both professionally and personally—drives my commitment to continuous development. I firmly believe in the power of introspection and the importance of maintaining a balance between mental and physical growth to achieve success.

I am always open to new challenges and opportunities to contribute, learn, and evolve in the world of technology.
