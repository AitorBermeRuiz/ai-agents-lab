## AI Learning & Project Lab

### **SECTION 1: Project Core Summary**

This document details my personal AI engineering lab, built to transition my skills from .NET to Python-based AI development.

#### **1.1: Metadata (Fact Sheet)**

* **Project Name:** [AI Agents Lab (Personal Learning Repository)](https://github.com/AitorBermeRuiz/ai-agents-lab)
* **Status:** Active Development
* **Purpose:** A hands-on "sandbox" to learn and implement Agentic AI concepts, AI architectures, and the Python data stack.
* **Context:** Self-directed learning, guided by resources like the "Mastering Agentic AI" course.
* **Core Technologies:** Python, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, Gradio.
* **Technologies (Exploring):** CrewAI, LangGraph, Multi-Agent Systems.

#### 1.2: Professional Value Statement (The "Why")

> This project is the primary evidence of my proactive transition into **AI Engineering** and represents my entire **personal learning initiative**. As an experienced **C#/.NET developer**, I am using this lab to learn the **Python** ecosystem from the ground up and build practical, end-to-end AI applications. It demonstrates initiative, self-directed learning, and the ability to master new, complex technology stacks.

### **SECTION 2: Key Completed Project: RAG Chatbot with Auto-Evaluation**

This is the flagship mini-project of the lab, demonstrating a complete RAG pipeline.

#### **2.1: Project Overview**

* **Status:** Functional and in continuous improvement.
* **Description:** A conversational AI chatbot that uses a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline to answer questions based on a private, local knowledge base.

#### **2.2: Core Features & Architecture**

1.  **RAG Pipeline:** Implemented from scratch using **LangChain** for orchestration. It loads, splits, embeds (via HuggingFace), and stores documents in a **ChromaDB** vector database.
2.  **Conversational Chat:** Uses the **OpenAI API (GPT-4/GPT-3.5)** to generate context-aware answers based on retrieved documents.
3.  **Automatic Evaluation:** A unique feature where the chatbot's own response is evaluated for quality by a separate AI call to the **Google Gemini API**. If the score is low, it attempts to re-generate the answer.
4.  **UI:** A simple web interface built with **Gradio** for quick prototyping and demonstration.
5.  **Code Structure:** Built on a modular Python architecture (Controller, RAG, Chat, Evaluator) to ensure separation of concerns.

#### **2.3: Skills Demonstrated (The "Proof")**

* **Python Development:** Proves my ability to learn and build functional applications in Python, coming from a C# background.
* **RAG Expertise:** Deep, practical understanding of the entire RAG lifecycle (Load, Chunk, Embed, Retrieve, Generate).
* **Vector Databases:** Hands-on experience with **ChromaDB** for semantic search.
* **Multi-API Integration:** Successfully integrated and orchestrated three distinct services: **OpenAI** (generation), **Google Gemini** (evaluation), and **HuggingFace** (embeddings).
* **AI Application Architecture:** Designed a modular, event-driven flow for a complex AI task.

### **SECTION 3: Current Learning & Next Steps**

My learning is continuous. While the RAG chatbot is functional, I am actively exploring the next phase of Agentic AI.

* **Current Focus:** Mastering advanced **Python** concepts (async/await, dependency management) and optimizing the RAG pipeline.
* **Next Steps:** My immediate learning goal is to move from single-pipeline RAG to multi-agent systems. I am actively beginning to experiment with frameworks like **CrewAI** and **LangGraph** to build systems where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex tasks.
