## 🤖 Optimized RAG Document 1: Project Deep Dive

### **SECTION 1: Project Core Summary**

This section provides the high-level pitch and metadata for quick retrieval.

#### **1.1: Project Metadata (Fact Sheet)**

* **Project Name:** Budget Automation & AI Integration (MCP Server)
* **Role:** Sole Architect & Full-Stack Developer
* **Domain:** FinTech Automation & AI Integration
* **Impact:** A production-ready, end-to-end solution demonstrating full-lifecycle development.
* **Core Technologies:** C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, Google Cloud APIs (Sheets v4), OAuth 2.0, Google Apps Script, Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **Complexity:** High (Multi-system integration, emerging protocols, cloud security).

#### **1.2: Professional Value Statement (The "Why")**

> **This project is the primary proof of my ability to transition from Senior Backend Developer to AI Engineer.** It demonstrates end-to-end system design, from a modular **.NET 8 backend** and complex **cloud API integration** (OAuth 2.0) to implementing an emerging **AI protocol (MCP)**. This is not a tutorial; it's an independently architected solution that solves a real-world problem, showcasing my readiness for complex **.NET**, **Cloud (Azure/GCP)**, and **AI-integrated** roles.

### **SECTION 2: Problem & Solution (Context)**

Provides context on the business need and the technical response.

#### **2.1: The Business Problem**

A secure, automated personal finance management system was needed without relying on third-party apps that require direct bank account access or costly subscriptions.

#### **2.2: The Technical Challenge**

To build a hybrid solution that was:
* **Secure:** No bank credentials shared.
* **Automated:** No repetitive manual data entry.
* **Intelligent:** Ready for conversational AI analysis (via Claude AI).
* **Scalable:** Architected for future feature growth.

#### **2.3: The Implemented Solution**

A hybrid system combining Google Sheets (as the DB), Google Apps Script (for automation), and a custom **C# .NET 8 MCP Server** acting as the secure bridge between the data and an AI model (Anthropic's Claude).

### **SECTION 3: Technical Expertise & Implementation**

This is the core "fodder" for the RAG. Each point is a specific, retrievable skill.

#### **3.1: Backend Development (C# / .NET 8 / AI Integration)**

* **Architecture:** Designed and built a complete **ASP.NET Core** application following **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles (Controllers, Services, Clients).
* **Protocol Implementation:** Implemented the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an emerging standard from Anthropic for AI model tool-use. This is a key skill for **AI Engineering**.
* **API Design:** Created secure **RESTful** endpoints to serve the MCP tools.
* **Core Skills:** Leveraged **Dependency Injection** (Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting), clear abstractions (Interfaces + Implementations), and robust **async/await** programming.
* **AI Tools:** Developed 4 functional MCP tools for the AI: `get_ranges`, `write_range`, `get_range_formulas`, and `write_formulas`, all with validation.

#### **3.2: Cloud Integration & Security (Google Cloud Platform)**

* **Authentication:** Implemented **OAuth 2.0** (server-to-server flow) from scratch using **Service Accounts** for secure Google Cloud API access.
* **API Consumption:** Integrated the **Google Sheets API v4** for all data manipulation.
* **Security:** Managed granular scopes, token lifecycles (including refresh tokens), and project credentials in the Google Cloud Console.
* **Error Handling:** Built robust error handling and logging for all external API calls.

#### **3.3: Automation & Scripting (Google Apps Script)**

* **Automation:** Wrote 550+ lines of optimized JavaScript (ES6+) to handle monthly data archiving and sheet cleanup.
* **DevOps:** Implemented time-based **triggers** (cron-like jobs) to run the archival process on the 1st of every month.
* **Logic:** Included complex data validation and handling for European number formats.

#### **3.4: Data Modeling & UI/UX**

* **Data Structure:** Designed a relational-like data model across 4 interconnected sheets (Expenses, Budget, Dashboard, History).
* **Business Logic:** Implemented complex **SUMIFS** formulas and `SPARKLINE` progress bars directly in the sheets for real-time dashboarding.
* **UI Design:** Created a professional, dark-mode dashboard with custom SVG icons and a clear navigation system, focusing on high readability and usability.

### **SECTION 4: Professional Applicability (The "Sales Pitch")**

This section explicitly bridges the project to the desired job roles.

#### **4.1: Transferable Value for .NET Backend Roles**

* Demonstrates mastery of **.NET 8** and **ASP.NET Core Web API**.
* Proves expertise in **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID**, and **Dependency Injection**.
* Shows deep experience with complex **REST API integration** and **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** security patterns.

#### **4.2: Transferable Value for Cloud (Azure) Roles**

* **Directly Analogous:** Expertise with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** APIs, Service Accounts, and IAM is directly transferable to **Azure**.
* **GCP (This Project) -> Azure (Target Role)**
    * *Google Apps Script* -> *Azure Functions (Timer Triggers)*
    * *GCP Service Account* -> *Azure Managed Identity / Service Principal*
    * *Google Cloud Console* -> *Azure Portal*
    * *Google Sheets API* -> *Microsoft Graph API (Excel)*

#### **4.3: Transferable Value for AI Engineering Roles (Key Differentiator)**

* **Emerging Tech:** Proves ability to work with **bleeding-edge AI technology** (Model Context Protocol).
* **AI Integration:** One of the first developers to implement an **MCP Server in C#**, requiring adaptation from Python/TypeScript docs.
* **Prompt Engineering Context:** This entire project *is* a form of advanced RAG/Tool-Use, providing a structured context (the tools) for an LLM (Claude) to act upon.
* **Adaptability:** Shows a clear methodology for learning and implementing new, poorly documented technologies—a critical skill in the fast-moving AI space.
